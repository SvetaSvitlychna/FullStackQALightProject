        Where does it come from?
    </h2>
    <p  align="center">
            <q>Contrary to popular belief</q>, <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is not simply random 
         text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
         making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
         at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more 
         obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> passage, 
         and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
         discovered the undoubtable source. <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> comes from sections 
         1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes 
         of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise 
         on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first 
         line of <b>Lorem Ipsum</b>, "<b>Lorem Ipsum</b> dolor sit amet..", comes from a line 
         in section 1.10.32.
        The standard chunk of <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> used since the 1500s is reproduced 
        below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from 
        "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their 
        exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 
        translation by H. Rackham.
