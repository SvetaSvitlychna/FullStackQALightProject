            <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and 
            typesetting industry. <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's 
            standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
            printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a 
            type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
            the release of Letraset sheets containing <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> 
            passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like 
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of <b>Lorem Ipsum</b>.
